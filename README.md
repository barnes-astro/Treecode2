This is an implementation of Treecode2 (Barnes 2026; MNRAS, accepted Feb 2, 2026), a gravitational N-body simulation code.  Like previous treecodes, it constructs a hierarchical representation of the mass distribution by enclosing the particles in a "root" cube, which is then recursively subdivided until each particles is isolated in a unique sub-cell.  Treecode2 randomly reorients, repositions, and resizes the root cube at each timestep, improving force accuracy and global conservation of energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum.

NOTE: the present code is a placeholder; it may not compile without some tweaking.  A fully self-contained version will be available shortly.
